# Pingpong Score Keeper
 This is my first website built with JavaScript and Bulma Framework. It contains a selector option to set the winning target and three additional buttons. The first and second are to increment Player 1's ad 2's scores respectively while the third is to Reset the game. All the logics are drawn with JavaScript. The overall layout is centered and designed with the Bulma CSS framework. Feel free to check out the app design from the link in the description.
